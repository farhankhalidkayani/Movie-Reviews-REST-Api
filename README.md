# Movie Review REST API

A REST API built with Node.js and Express that allows users to add movies, post reviews, and rate movies. The API is secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, ensuring that only registered users can post reviews and rate movies. Admin users have additional privileges to manage movies.

- Posting, retrieving, and deleting movie reviews

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and receive a JWT for secure access.
- **Movie Management**: Admins can add, update, and delete movies.
- **Review System**: Registered users can post and view reviews for movies.

## Testing
- **Manual Testing**: Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test each endpoint and check:
  - CRUD operations for users, movies, and reviews.
  - JWT-protected endpoints for user authentication.

## Future Improvements
- **Favorites Feature**: Allow users to mark movies as favorites.
- **Admin Management**: Enable admin users to manage user reviews.
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Add advanced search features to filter movies by additional criteria.
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Improve test coverage for all endpoints and scenarios.
